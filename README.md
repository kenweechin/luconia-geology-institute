### **Design Choices**

![Responsive Mockup](wireframes/mockup.png)

* Imagery 
    * The main background image on the home page is using a large image of an offshore rig. The idea of using this offshore rig picture is to catch user's attention. It gives a feeling of the relation between the course and the potential future employment environment.
    * The modules backgrounds are set to be geology-related because those images are the real example of study cases which fit into each module respectively.
* Color Scheme
    * The main colours used are dark cyan for the navigation bar and institute title, and teal blue colour for the bottom footer section. 
    * White colour is used for the title and text to give a contrast so it is easy for the user to read. 
    * Lightning yellow colour is used for the top navigation link when these links have hovered which present a great contrast to the navigation colour. 
* Typography
    * Oswald and Roboto font are the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font is not being imported correctly to the site.
    * Oswald and Roboto font looks good on a wide range of screens which are mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
* Styling
    * Each of the links/pages has the same navigation menu so the user can direct to the other main navigation sites when they are browsing particular links.
    * Each of the links/pages has a background image to show consistency throughout the web pages. 
    * Each of the links/pages has the contact information and social media links so the user can acquire the information of the institute easily.

# **Features**

Each page consists of a responsive navigation bar sitting at the top page. The branding of the website is located on the top left, whereas the navigation links are situated on the top right. Each page consists of a footer 
with the contact and location details of the institute, together with the social media icons linking to each social media platform.  

The navigation links comprise the home page, why us page, modules page, and sign up page. Each of this page features a specific main background image to match the information that the particular page is trying to show to the audience. Those images 
contain the upper half of the webpage.

Home

The Home page features the main background image of an offshore rig that contains the landing page. This idea is to give the audience a visual impact and relate this image to the course provided by the institute. All the navigation links are shown at the top-right position with a white font colour to give contrast to the cyan background colour. The title of the course is shown on the landing page which can be seen easily following by a brief description of the course structure. 
The navigation links are consistent across desktop, laptop, and tablet resolution, whereas a menu bar is shown in mobile resolution to fit the relatively small screen size. The affiliated company logos are shown as well and featured with 
links so the user can search for more information about the partner company by directing to a new page.  

After the affiliated company logos are the modules section which the institute is offering. They are aligned side by side with the name of the modules attached. Each of the modules has a background image that is relating to the course. A link right below is named: "Read More"
is shown so the user can direct to the module page with a click to explore the details of the course. Easy navigation is vital for the user so the navigation bar is fixed at the top, hence it is always shown when the user scrolls down the page. 

Why Us

The Why Us page features the main image showing a group of students working together in a library with book racks behind them which indicates the study environment of the institute. The page consists of the three reasons for choosing the institute. Each reason section has a small image and a description. These reasons are to show to the user the advantages of choosing this institute in terms of learning, funding, and internship opportunity.
In the mobile resolution, the images which are placed right beside the description are hidden to conserve the limited space on mobile screen size and shows only the important description to the user.  
 
Modules

The modules link is shown as a dropdown in the navigation bar. Each of the modules is shown accordingly when the user clicks on the modules link. The three modules have their own webpage with a background image and the module title wrap within the image. The middle section of the page is the module detail. The user can get to know what are the learning outcomes and level up their competitiveness.  
 
Apply Now

The Apply Now page features a contact form that requires the user to fill up their name, email, phone number, username, and password. The bottom of the form consists of a submit button named **Register Now**. The forms are aligned on top of each other in mobile resolution.
